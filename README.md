## Why I made this

I started this little project just to mess around and see if I remembered any HTML and CSS, but seeing as I had to use JS for the countdown itself, I decided to take this as a learning experience and ended up with what you see. I also wanted to give Git and GitHub a try and ended up creating my first repo. This project got me excited to learn more.
