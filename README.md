## Why I made this

At first I was just messing around when I decided to do this, as a way to remember how HTML and CSS worked, then I realized I would need to do some JavaScript for the countdown itself, so I learned a little bit by following some tutorials. Then I wanted to try Git and creating a repo for the first time, and here it is. I kind of got excited about this little project, and will definitely be pursuing front-end or full-stack development.
